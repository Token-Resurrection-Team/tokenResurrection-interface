### Important Notes:

- Signature doesn't cost you any gas and there's no risk for any funds loss.
- Make sure you have enough gas fees in your wallet for the token claim transaction.
- The claim process does not deduct any tokens from your wallet; it only unlocks tokens currently held in the contract.
